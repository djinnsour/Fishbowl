The sales department asked me to create a report showing the Sales order number, Customer purchase order number, Salesperson, Customer bill-to name, 
Total price of the sales order, Date the order was fulfilled, Shipping carrier, and Tracking ID.  They wanted the report to be restricted to fulfilled
orders within the last day. 

The query in DailySOFulfillmentReport.sql is what I used to get the information for the report. I used this query in a BASH script that dumps the
results to a csv then format them into an Excel spreadsheet and email it to their group at 6:30AM each weekday morning. I also include the same report,
but for the last 7 days in case there is a holiday.
