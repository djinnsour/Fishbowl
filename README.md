Fishbowl Inventory scripts, queries, etc.

I am going to start putting the various scripts, queries, etc. I made Fishbowl Inventory in this repository.  I don't see a lot of similar things from other people so maybe this will help someone.

If you have any questions regarding them please feel free to contact me.

DailySOFulfillmentReport

Our sales department wanted a report of all Sales Orders that were fulfilled every day.  They did not like the Fishbowl reporting method for this task.  They wanted an email showing the fulfilled orders, and any tracking information.  So, this queries Fishbowl Inventory for any orders that were fulfilled and produces a report that is then emailed to the sales department using another script.

InventorySummary 

This is a series of MySQL queries and other files used to product an inventory summary of changes during a period of time.  It queries Fishbowl Inventory and produces a web based report.

Inventory Count Report

This is a quick report for generating an Inventory Count.
